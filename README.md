# Periocular-Recognition-Library
## Motivation.
Due to a mandation of face masks, using authentication systems has become a necessity . Thus, this library helps you in registering an user and using a face authentication service 
whilst wearing a face mask. 

## How to use this Library
You will only need to files from this repositiory viz [Recognise a person](https://github.com/adityakhambete/Periocular-Recognition-Library/blob/master/recognisePerson.py)
and [Register a new person](https://github.com/adityakhambete/Periocular-Recognition-Library/blob/master/registerNewPerson.py)

Please remember to update the model so that the new user is stored into the existing database. This will increase the accuracy of recognizing the new user.
To update a model [use this file](https://github.com/adityakhambete/Periocular-Recognition-Library/blob/master/addNewLabel.py) and then the model will be trained 
once you [run this file](https://github.com/adityakhambete/Periocular-Recognition-Library/blob/master/trainUpdatedModel.py)


All of the other files are the backend of this project. Feel free to explore them.

The Dataset was taken from an opensource platform with additional images taken from a smartphone camera.
